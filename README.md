## SOLID PRINCIPLES
A set of object-oriented design principles that aim to help developers write code that is easily extensible, 
maintainable and more reusable.
- Single-Responsibility Principle - 
  Classes should have a single purpose
- Open-Closed Principle - Open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution - behavioural clas substitution. If Type A is derived from type B then 
  you should be able to substitute objects of type B for objects of type A
- Interface Segregation - Favor multiple, specific interfaces over single interface
- Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions not implementations. high level modules should not depend on low level modules
